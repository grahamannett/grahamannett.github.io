<h2>
installation</h2>
<p>although it is possible to install with brew via <br>
brew install go<br>
i kept getting problems with GOPATH, godocs and while using sublimetext, so if you can get these all to work then by all means go with that.  otherwise i would suggest using the official installer at <a href="http://golang.org/doc/install">golang install</a>
