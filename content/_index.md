novel ideas for generative neural networks including:

- [using generative neural nets in keras to create ‘on-the-fly’ dialogue](http://neuralniche.com/post/tutorial/)
- [dockerfile for tensorflow 0.7 with python3 on gpu](http://neuralniche.com/post/tensorflow/)
- [basics of setting up a containerized telegram bot](http://neuralniche.com/post/telegram-bot/)

### [Simple Transfer Learning Tutorial](https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/transfer-learning)

### [iMessage dashboard visualization](http://gitlab.com/besiktas/iskrt)
- interactive visualization tool for iMessage built using dc.js and crossfilter

### [kaggle bike project](http://github.com/grahamannett/bike-kaggle)

# old classwork

### appm
- [Stochastic Modeling Of Pseudomonos Syringae Growth](http://mathbio.colorado.edu/index.php/MBW:Stochastic_modeling_of_Pseudomonos_syringae_growth)
      - final project: recreation of mathematical model in matlab incorporating random numbers, stochastic simulations and population carrying capacity
- [Network Models: Firing Rate, Feedforward And Recurrent Models](http://mathbio.colorado.edu/index.php/MBW:Network_Models:_Firing_Rate%2C_Feedforward_and_Recurrent_Models)
      + long before i had much knowledge or even knew what deep learning was, did a project based on mathematical modeling of neural systems.  

### econ
- [mathematica notebook on heston model](files/HestonModel.pdf)
